# Energy in Science

## How we describe energy in physics and chemistry

* Kinematics: $W = Fx$
* Electricity: $E = Pt = IVt$
* Chemistry: $\Delta U$
* Mass-Energy: $E = mc^2$

## How it's taught

* Friction and air resistance are often negligible or ignored at first
  * There is a *very* good reason for this
    * Finding drag coefficients is hard
    * Finding friction of flowing fluids is hard
  * Most of these values have to be measured experimentally, and don't stay uniform

## Easier units

We like SI units. We use them wherever we can.

* SI makes units easily interchangeable
  * $E = Fx = m \times a \times x$
  * $1 \textrm{J} = \frac{1 \textrm{m} \times 1 \textrm{kg}}{\textrm{s}^2} \times 1 \textrm{m}$
* Base-10 arithmetic is pretty easy
* Nobody can remember how imperial units work

## How it's used

* Energy in physics and chemistry is all about what energy does to a system
* This is a very narrow frame of reference, but very useful for examining those
  small systems

This is not necessarily how it's done in the energy industry.
