# "The" Grid

----

There are several entities that manage grids in North America.

## NERC

North American Electric Reliability Corporation

----

NERC oversees the interconnection regions for the U.S. and Canada

Interconnection's purpose is to connect smaller regions and markets together in one big
physical grid. This means if it's really hot in Arizona, California can "export"
electricity to the Southwest region for use.

This helps maintain reliability.

## FERC

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission

----

FERC regulates the different energy markets in the United States.

* Own most of the transmission and distribution infrastructure
  * Transmission: 10+ kV
  * Distribution: 240-480 V
  * Substations
* Investor-Owned

It's important to know that an electricity market refers to the *wholesale* cost of
electricity and other services. It's what utilities and power plant operators pay
to one another.

(Basically, it's not what you see an on electric bill.)

And to participate in the wholesale market, you have to have a load or production capacity
of about 100 kW.

Given this knowledge, what have you noticed about Texas?
