# Energy Systems Thinking

## Systems thinking?

It's the difference between thinking about a single corn plant and *all* the corn in Iowa.

## Bizarre units

In the energy space, there a bunch of units to be aware of, but which units are used
is largely determined by *scale* and *context*.

## Watts

* Used for electricity and fuels
* End use: kWh
* Industrial or power plant scale: MWh or GWh
  * San Onofre NGS reactors 2 and 3 are each rated for about 1.1 GW

## Megajoules: MJ

* Used for fuels, electricity, and others

## British Thermal Unit: Btu

* Used for fuels
* Quadrillion Btu, or "quads"
  * $10^{15} Btu \approx 293,071.07 GWh$

## Gal. Gasoline Equivalent: GGE

1 GGE $\approx$ 131.76 MJ $\approx$ 36.6 kWh.

------ ------------- -----
Fuel   LHV (Btu/gal)  GGE
------ ------------- -----
Diesel       128,488  1.12
B100         119,550  1.05
B20          126,700  1.11
E100          76,330  0.67

These units are useful to use for examining how energy *flows* through an economy.
