# A Big Green Deal

## Common terms

There are many terms we can use to describe energy (specifically electricity) production.

Some can be loaded terms, and others may be misleading.

## Renewables

Resources that are effectively infinite, and can be replaced about as fast as
they are used.

* Includes: wind, solar, biomass, geothermal, and hydro
* Status of "renewable" depending on jurisdiction
    * In California, only "small hydro" (‚â§ 30 MW) is considered renewable
* Wood is renewable, but doesn't make a good fuel

## Low-carbon

Energy sources that do not emit large amounts of greenhouse gases

* Includes: nuclear (fission and *fusion*), wind, solar, geothermal, and hydro
* Nuclear (fission) has almost no carbon emissions, but uranium is not a renewable fuel

## Clean

* Clean coal *is* cleaner than *traditional* coal, but generally refers to reductions
  in *local* pollutants
  * Soot and particulates (PM~2.5~) that cause asthma and other issues
  * Sulfur oxides (SO~x~) causes smog
  * Nitrous oxides (NO~x~)
* Clean coal does *not* mean it is clean in terms of global pollutants, namely CO~2~
* Natural gas doesn't have the local pollutant problems coal does
  * But it's only a little less carbon-intensive

## Nuclear üëç

* Compared with fossil fuels, has fewer impacts (in practice) to human health and environment
* Western power plants actually have a good safety record (safe enough for warships)

## Nuclear üëé

* Uranium mining and refining
* Fissile material means countries can also make (lower yield) nuclear weapons
* Meltdowns

## Meltdowns ‚ò¢

* Three Mile Island: Partial meltdown, no contamination escaped containment vessel
* Fukushima: Result of a tsunami knocking out the plant's cooling water pumps
* Chernobyl: Soviets were recklessly incompetant in handling of a finicky reactor design
  * Chernobyl had no containment structures like you see at San Onofre

## Intermittancy

A source is *intermittant* when its production cannot be called on at will. The opposite 
of intermittent is *dispatchable*.

* Solar
  * Requires...the sun
  * Efficiency decreases as temperature rises
* Wind
  * Wind doesn't always blow
* Hydro
  * May have limited availability in drought years
