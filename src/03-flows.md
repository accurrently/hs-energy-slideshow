## Kaya identity

$$
F = P \times \frac{G}{P} \times \frac{E}{G} \times \frac{F}{E}
$$

* $F$ is Carbon emissions
* $P$ is Population
* $\frac{G}{P}$ GDP per capita
* $\frac{E}{G}$ is energy intensity of an economy
* $\frac{F}{E}$ is carbon intensity of the energy 

## Breakout Discussion

The Kaya identity, while broad, essentially covers the problem of climate change and
energy use. For the time being, humans have not been able to completely decarbonize any
economy.

In a breakout group, find three social, environmental, economic, or moral implications
of the Kaya identity.
