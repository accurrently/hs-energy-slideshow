# California's Electricity Market

----

California has a regulated wholesale electricity market managed by CAISO.

Regulation exists, but the government only really steps in when it needs to.

## Economics Strikes Back

Because you cannot store electric energy in wires, the electricity market is almost one
of the best models of pure supply-and-demand model you could hope for.

For most puproses, electricity must be used as soon as it it generated.

For every load on the system, a generator somewhere has to serve that load.
